For validation using the 0.01 of the full dataset running each case once:
  The optimal hyperparameters for toxic  is (5, 5, 5, 5)
  The validation score associated was 0.916913946588
  The optimal hyperparameters for severe_toxic  is (5, None, 2, 1)
  The validation score associated was 1.0
  The optimal hyperparameters for obscene  is (5, None, 2, 1)
  The validation score associated was 0.952522255193
  The optimal hyperparameters for threat  is (5, None, 2, 1)
  The validation score associated was 0.991097922849
  The optimal hyperparameters for insult  is (10, None, 5, 1)

For validation using 0.01 of the full dataset running each case 10 times and averaging:
  The optimal hyperparameters for toxic  is (5, None, 2, 1)
  The average validation score associated was 0.913981762918
  The optimal hyperparameters for severe_toxic  is (5, 15, 2, 1)
  The average validation score associated was 0.987234042553
  The optimal hyperparameters for obscene  is (10, 15, 5, 1)
  The average validation score associated was 0.959574468085
  The optimal hyperparameters for threat  is (5, None, 2, 1)
  The average validation score associated was 0.993920972644
  The optimal hyperparameters for insult  is (5, None, 2, 1)
  The average validation score associated was 0.958662613982
  The optimal hyperparameters for identity_hate  is (5, None, 2, 1)
  The average validation score associated was 0.996960486322

Conclusion: Changing the hyper-parameters don't have much of an effect on the
validation accuracy.
